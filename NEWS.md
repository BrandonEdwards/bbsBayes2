* Second release. Includes access to the 2023 release of the BBS database. Also includes improvements to the management of the csv files created by Stan, increased ability to map values from `generate_trends()`, tweaks to the first_diff models to better handle the missing data in 2020 (when no BBS surveys were conducted), and options to use highest posterior density intervals (hpdi) to describe the posterior distribution in `generate_indices()` and `generate_trends()`. 


# bbsBayes2 1.0.0

* First release of bbsBayes2, the successor to bbsBayes!
