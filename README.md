bbsBayes2 is a package for performing hierarchical Bayesian analysis of North
American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. 'bbsBayes2' will run a full model
analysis for one or more species that you choose, or you can take more control
and specify how the data should be stratified, prepared for Stan, or modelled.

Installation instructions are below.

See the [documentation](https://bbsBayes.github.io/bbsBayes2) for an overview of
how to use bbsBayes2.
